Similar changes also occurred beneath Berk’s surface, where a reinforced hangar, complete stables, feeding troughs, and a dragon wash now occupy the old Whispering Death catacombs.\n\nDespite Drago Bludvist’s vicious attack on the island, Berk survived the Bewilderbeast’s barrage and emerged from the fray stronger than ever. Now joined by the full compliment of Valka’s flock and the liberated members of Drago’s army, the people of Berk take to the skies on the backs of their dragons to protect their home and spread their message of peace.

There, from deep within a pool of lava, the Red Death commanded all dragons to raid Viking villages and return with all stolen foods to feed its ravenous appetite. \n\nUpon learning of Dragon Island’s true location, Stoick the Vast led his Viking army to attack the Red Death, and nearly perished before a timely rescue from Hiccup, Toothless, and their fellow dragon riders. Berk’s victory over the Red Death came at a cost, but that sacrifice was far outweighed by the truth proven by Hiccup and Toothless: humans and dragons can and must work together for the betterment of all.",

Village elder Gothi was once part of an expedition into these frozen hinterlands years ago, and barely survived the experience.\n\nThe Snow Wraith is to winter what the Night Fury is to night.
